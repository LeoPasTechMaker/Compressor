# üìÅ Compressor

## Introduction

A little python program that compresses data. Works better when there's more data. Decompression doesn't really work
on images, so it is best to try it with text files.

## Run the code

If you want to try it your self, first make sure you have 
installed python 3.7 or above. Then download the `compressor.py`
file.  
At this point, open a terminal, go to the folder where you 
have the python file with `cd "your/path"` and run
`python3 compressor.py "file/you want/to compress"`  
It will create two files : `compressed.cmprs` and `decompressed.idklol`

Have fun !
